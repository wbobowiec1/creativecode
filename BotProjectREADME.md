# Bot Project

This bot, [@Love_Kindess](https://twitter.com/Love_Kindess), is creating shareable compliments for the public. They are random compliments that anyone is able to give to others. Created for people to share to others to make their day a little bit better. The bot tweets twice a day and dosen't reply to tweets sent to it. 

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar. Here is the source code I created on there, [Source Code](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/Love_Kindess). 

# Walk Through of The Code

- origin section is what will be the end result of the code and what will end up being treated. 
- them section is when the bot is talking about the person the compliment is being given too. 
- them2 section is similar to Them section but it is a lowercase version so it can be used in the middle of a sentence. 
- mine section is when the bot is referring to whoever is giving the compliment.
- look section is for when the bot is describing the physical traits of the person who is receiving the compliments.
- description section is for when the bot is desccribing the nonphysical traits of the person who is receiving the compliments.
- peopleDescribe section is for when the bot is describing how the person receiving the compliments affects others' lives. 
- have section is for when the bot is describing the good qualities the person receiving the compliments have.
