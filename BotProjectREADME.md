# Bot Project

This bot, [@Love_Kindess](https://twitter.com/Love_Kindess), is creating shareable compliments for the public. They are random compliments that anyone is able to give to others. Created for people to share to others to make their day a little bit better. 

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar. Here is the source code I created on there, [Source Code](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/Love_Kindess).
