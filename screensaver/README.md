# Screensaver: Creative Code Project

This project is a "screensaver" designed for any use, more for aesthetics more than anything. The first canvas is of very thin circles that makes them look like small horizontal lines. These lines repeat randomly throughout the screen. Their coloring of these lines randomly change between bright blue to a lighter version of that bright blue and it changes while it is drawing the lines randomly throughout the screen. The extra canvas ontop of the first canvas is doing the same concept as what the first canvas is doing but this time with a different shape and different colors. The shape this time is rectangle and the colors are variation of shades of purple. 

For version I'm sharing here, run it by copying the javascript [source code](https://github.com/wbobowiec1/creativecode/blob/master/screensaver/ScreensaverCreativeCode.js) into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org). 

The inspiration for this project is the classic [Randomness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmV2kuQKwA).
