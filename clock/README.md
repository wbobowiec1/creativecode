# My Clock

This is a unique clock I made with p5.js. There is two canvases used in this project too, just like the screensaver project. On the first canvas is the clock and then on the second canvas is the flicking dot in the middle of the clock. The dot changes colors randomly by itself, it switches between various mixtures of blue,green, and red. 

To read the clock's time, you have to look at the rings and lines. The inner ring (cyan) is hours, the middle ring (light blue) is the number of minutes past the hour, and the outer (dark blue) ring is the number of seconds past the minute. The cyan and thinnest line is the hours. The light blue and second thickest line is the minutes. The dark blue and thickest line is the seconds. 

Not all of the code is purposeful like as much as the code for the clock is. The background color, thickness of lines and the rings, and the dot are just all aesthetics and just for design look. Usually the hands of the clock are much shorter and would not go beyong the ring of the clock, but I wanted to make my unique so I made mine extend much further out. I though did not wnat it to look too ridiculous so I made sure the hands were not extended past the canvas boundaries. I wanted to make my clock look much bigger than just a skinny clock so I made the hands and rings much thicker but I also wanted to make each hands and rings unique by having varied colors,thickness, and length. The dot is placed in the middle of the clock to signal that is where all the lines extend from and as mentioned before just for aesthetics.2

For version I'm sharing here, run it by copying the javascript [source code](https://github.com/wbobowiec1/creativecode/blob/master/clock/clock.js) into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org). 

The inspiration for this project is the classic [Coding Challenge #74: Clock with p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4RyStef-gY) and [Crazy Clock on p5.js](https://youtu.be/H_DolEtz5jo)
