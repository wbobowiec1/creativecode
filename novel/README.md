# Generate A Novel Of My Own

This project folder contains an example for generating a novel, as definied by [NaNoGenMo](http://nanogenmo.github.io). 


## Tracery Bookery
The enclosed [story.json](story.json) file is a Tracery grammar that should expand a few sentences into something like 50,000 words. The actual word count will vary based on the length and number of the core sentences.

This JSON file can be dropped into [this template](https://github.com/zachwhalen/bookery).

Here is the cleaner look of the program [Copy_of_TextGenerationPyTracery.ipynb](https://github.com/wbobowiec1/CreativeCodeClass/blob/master/Copy_of_TextGenerationPyTracery.ipynb)

I used [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) to create this program. I needed PyTracery to create my program but Colab does not have that on it's own so I had to first install PyTracery to Colab Notebook. Next I needed to install the markdown option and random choice option like I used in my previous project, the poem project [Poem Project](https://github.com/wbobowiec1/creativecode/tree/master/poem).
